# track_and_field
A repo with the code I used to build a Tableau Track and Field visualisation tool.

Main.py scrapes the current all-time rankings data and then uploads the files to this google sheet. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPHHM-L2jcldWxFc2a8-_5bAe9ZhAdmwwr4MKcQcut8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

The google sheet is then read by Tableau.
